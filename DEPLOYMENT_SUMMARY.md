## ‚ö†Ô∏è Issue Discovered

**Railway Service Configuration Mismatch:**
- The Railway Storefront service is currently configured to deploy from: `rpuls/medusajs-2.0-for-railway-boilerplate`
- Our code was pushed to: `HBAGRO/railwaystorefront`
- The triggered deployment pulled from the old repository (commit bc33900) instead of our new code with fixes

### Deployment Details:
- Service: Storefront
- Environment: production
- Deployment ID: f7028ca3-43d1-433b-be0c-161767c606a3
- Status: FAILED (deployed wrong repository)
- URL: https://storefront-production-6135.up.railway.app

## üîß Required Action

To complete the deployment, the Railway service source needs to be updated:

**Option 1: Update via Railway Dashboard (Recommended)**
1. Go to Railway dashboard: https://railway.app/project/IOX
2. Select the "Storefront" service
3. Go to Settings ‚Üí Source
4. Update the GitHub repository to: HBAGRO/railwaystorefront
5. Update the branch to: master
6. Save and trigger a new deployment

**Option 2: Manual Configuration**
The Railway GraphQL API mutations for updating service source encountered errors, so manual dashboard configuration is required.

## üìã Next Steps

1. Update the Railway service source configuration (see above)
2. Trigger a new deployment from the Railway dashboard
3. Monitor the deployment to ensure it uses the correct repository
4. Verify the fixes are deployed by checking the live site

## üì¶ Deployed Fixes

Once properly configured, the deployment will include:
- Frontend routing fixes
- Configuration improvements
- Quote Request feature
- All other committed changes
